#This project is the realization of a test project to Mindbox. Needed to accomplish:
#Write a library for delivery to external customers that knows how to calculate the area of a circle by radius and a triangle by three sides. Extra:
- Unit Tests
- Ease of adding other shapes
- Calculating the area of a figure without knowing the type of figure
- Checking if a triangle is a right triangle
